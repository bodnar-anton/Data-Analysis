      "text:  b\"The Groovy P. and I ventured to his old stomping grounds for lunch today.  The '5 and Diner' on 16th St and Colter left me with little to ask for.  Before coming here I had a preconceived notion that 5 & Diners were dirty and nasty. Not the case at all.\\\\n\\\\nWe walk in and let the waitress know we want to sit outside (since it's so nice and they had misters).  We get two different servers bringing us stuff (talk about service) and I ask the one waitress for recommendations.  I didn't listen to her, of course, and ordered the Southwestern Burger w/ coleslaw and started with a nice stack of rings.\\\\n\\\\nThe Onion Rings were perfectly cooked.  They looked like they were prepackaged, but they were very crispy and I could actually bite through the onion without pulling the entire thing out (don't you hate that?!!!)\\\\n\\\\nThe Southwestern Burger was order Medium Rare and was cooked accordingly.  Soft, juicy, and pink with a nice crispy browned outer layer that can only be achieved on a well used grill.  The creaminess of the chipotle mayo paired beautifully with the green chiles.  Unfortunately, because I ate too many onion rings, I couldn't finish my burger.  What a shame!\\\\n\\\\nThe Coleslaw was just how I like it.  It's hard to find a really good coleslaw.  I prefer mine to be slightly sweet, not sour.  Too much vinegar in slaw ruins it in my opinion.  This slaw had the perfect marriage of mayo, vinegar, and sugar. Not to mention carrots...\\\\n\\\\nMy experience here was great!  The servers were top notch and kept my water full the entire time and actually chatted with us for a few minutes.\\\\n\\\\nThere is an artist guy named Ross who has been there every day for 5393 days straight. No, not an employee.  He goes there and does his art! He hasn't missed a SINGLE day!!! That's like... 15 years! So if you wanna seem to be 'in the know' ask where Ross is... They'll be able to tell you.\\\\n\\\\nTime for a nap!\"\n",
